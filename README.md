# Fessage File Transfer (Socket Programming)
This repository contains the semester project developed by Jaysh Khan and Muhammad Aaraif Hanif, students at Riphah International University. The project, Fessage File Transfer, is a Java application that facilitates the transfer of files from one PC to another via Socket Programming.

## Overview
Built with fundamental knowledge of Java and Swing UI, this project serves as a practical exploration of network programming and user interface design. The project was developed using NetBeans IDE, demonstrating an integration of technologies to create a functional application.

The Fessage File Transfer system is mostly functional but may occasionally throw a storage error after transferring one or two files. This is a known issue and any contributions towards resolving this problem or improving the project in general are greatly appreciated.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:

Java: The core programming language used to build the application.
Swing UI: A widget toolkit for Java, used to create the application's user interface.
MySQL: Used for the database management system.
XAMPP: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, which was used to simplify the use of MySQL.
Known Issues
Errors may arise from hardcoded locations in the code. We aim to address this in future updates and your contributions towards this would be highly beneficial.

## Contribute
Feel free to dive in! Open an issue or submit PRs. We welcome any contributors who are interested in improving this project.
